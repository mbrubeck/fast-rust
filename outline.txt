Intro
  What this book is for
  Types of performance
    Speed/latency
    Memory
    Code size

Specific optimizations
  Tuning build options
    Cargo profiles
    rustc options (opt-level, lto, panic=abort, codegen-units)
    jemalloc
  Machine types, memory layout
    fixed-sized versus pointer-sized ints
    f32 versus f64
    struct/enum packing
  Iterating
    bounds checks
  Static dispatch
    (example with trait objects?)
  Allocation
    which operations allocate?
    borrowing versus cloning
    re-using buffers
  Threads
    scoped threads
    atomics, locks, lock-free
    libraries
      parking_lot
      rayon
      crossbeam
  Async I/O
  Data structures
    vectors, lists, arrays, deques
      smallvec
    maps/sets
      custom hashers

Test cases
  JSON processing
    Parser library
      Inlining
      Buffered I/O
      Zero-copy, COW
      Avoid UTF-8 validation
      Streaming versus in-memory
    Tree traversal and computation
      Paralellization
